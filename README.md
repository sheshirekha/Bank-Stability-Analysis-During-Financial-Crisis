# Bank-Stability-Analysis-During-Financial-Crisis
In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis of stock prices through data visualization, focusing on bank stocks during the financial crisis from January 1st, 2006 through January 1st, 2016.

The project aimed to analyze the stock information of six major banks - Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo - during the specified period.

Using Quandl as the data source and pandas datareader to create dataframes for each bank, I performed various analyses to gain insights into the stock market trends and behaviors during the financial crisis.

The exploratory data analysis included:

- Finding the maximum close price for each bank's stock during the period.
- Calculating the percent change (returns) of the stocks.
- Visualizing the returns using seaborn pairplot to identify correlations between banks.
- Using heat and cluster maps to explore correlations among banks.
- Investigating outliers and anomalies in the data, such as extreme stock movements.
- Analyzing the standard deviation (volatility) of bank returns over time.
- Comparing the distribution of returns for different years to understand market fluctuations.
- Examining the movement of each stock over the period and analyzing rolling averages.
- Utilizing technical analysis plots, such as candlestick charts and Bollinger Bands, for stock assessment.
  
Through this project, I discovered insights into the correlation between stock prices and returns, the impact of market events on stock performance, and the importance of considering anomalies in data analysis. Additionally, I gained experience in analyzing web stock data using Quandl and pandas in Python, enabling me to conduct detailed analyses efficiently.
